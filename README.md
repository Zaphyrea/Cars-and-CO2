You have two possibilities to try this app.
For the first you will need .csv, .ipynb and .py files
You need to run the jupyter notebook file to select the best model from those tested. The notebook will create 3 .pkl files which will be used by the main.py file.
Then you can run the python file and it will launch the app on a Streamlit interface.

If you choose the second option, you will need .csv, .py and 3 .pkl files
Here you just have to run the main to launch the app.
